## Key Insights

### The System 1 vs. System 2 Tension

This is the bedrock of my "Think Slow, Do Fast" philosophy. In AdTech, we often design for System 1 (quick, intuitive clicks), but as a leader, I must reside in System 2—the slow, effortful, logical processing required to interpret complex data.

## Leadership Lessons

### Avoiding Cognitive Bias

In a data-driven environment like Buzzvil, it is easy to see patterns that aren't there. Kahneman taught me to doubt the first "intuitive" interpretation of a metric.

## Practical Applications

### Data as an Indicator

I use System 2 to deeply analyze BI event boards before allowing the team to move into high-velocity execution.

## Favorite Quote

> "Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it."

## How It Shaped My Work

It gave me the vocabulary to defend "thinking time" to stakeholders. It is why I advocate for deep research before any pixels are drawn. This principle directly influenced how I approach [design system work](/blog/design-system-at-buzzvil) and [operational management](/blog/high-output-management).
