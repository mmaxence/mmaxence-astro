## Key Insights

### Managerial Leverage

A manager's output is the output of their team.

## Leadership Lessons

### Scaling from 24 to 130

As Buzzvil grew, Grove's principles helped me transition from a solo designer to a CDO managing a full organization.

## Practical Applications

### The Automated Creative Review

By automating ad image validation, I increased the "leverage" of my design team, freeing them for high-impact product work.

## Favorite Quote

> "A manager's output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence."

## How It Shaped My Work

Grove's concept of managerial leverage directly influenced how I structure the design organization. By automating repetitive tasks and focusing on high-leverage activities, I've scaled the team's impact without proportionally increasing headcount. I wrote a detailed article about [applying these principles to design management](/blog/high-output-management), and this approach was foundational in building our [design system](/blog/design-system-at-buzzvil) and [current design stack](/blog/2026-buzzvil-design-stack).
