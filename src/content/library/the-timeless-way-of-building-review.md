## Key Insights

### The Quality Without a Name

That feeling when a system feels "right" and the interface becomes invisible.

## Practical Applications

### Interaction Primitives

We build loading states and transitions first—these are the "living patterns" Alexander describes.

## How It Shaped My Work

It is the philosophical reason why I advocate for a "Lego Box" of components rather than static mockups. This approach is central to our [design system philosophy](/blog/design-system-at-buzzvil) and the [interaction primitives](/blog/design-system-at-buzzvil) we build.
