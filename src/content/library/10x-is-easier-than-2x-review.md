## Key Insights

### Elimination over Optimization

10x growth requires stopping 80% of what doesn't work.

## Practical Applications

### The Digital Diet

Waving goodbye to the entire Adobe suite to focus exclusively on a code-connected Figma/Cursor stack.

## How It Shaped My Work

The elimination principle directly influenced our tooling strategy. Rather than trying to optimize every design tool, we eliminated the Adobe suite entirely and focused on a unified, code-connected stack that enables 10x faster iteration. This is detailed in our [2026 Design Stack](/blog/2026-buzzvil-design-stack) article.
