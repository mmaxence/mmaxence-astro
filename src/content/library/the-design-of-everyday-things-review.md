## How It Shaped My Work

Norman's concepts of affordances and signifiers are the foundation of my Interaction Design specialty. In our ad products, we make reward effort and value clear through design rather than instruction, ensuring users understand what they're getting without reading explanations. This is central to how we design [interaction systems for ads](/blog/i-dont-like-ads) and build [design system components](/blog/design-system-at-buzzvil).
