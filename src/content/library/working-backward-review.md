## Key Insights

### The PR/FAQ Framework

Starting with the press release ensures the "Aha Moment" is defined before a single line of code is written.

## Leadership Lessons

### Customer Obsession as a Metric

Shifting from "what can we build?" to "what does the publisher need to reduce their cost?".

## Practical Applications

### Game UA Onboarding

We worked backward from the user's "Aha Moment" inside the game to design our multi-mission ad flows.

## Favorite Quote

> "Working Backwards is a repeatable, objective process for making decisions."

## How It Shaped My Work

The PR/FAQ framework has become a standard part of our product development process, ensuring we define success metrics and user value before building anything. This approach was crucial in developing our ["Game UA" product](/blog/i-dont-like-ads), where we worked backward from the user's "Aha Moment" to design the interaction flow.
