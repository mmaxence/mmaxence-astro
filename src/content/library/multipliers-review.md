## Key Insights

### Diminishers vs. Multipliers

Some leaders drain intelligence; others amplify it.

## Leadership Lessons

### Autonomous Teams

I strive to be a "Challenger" multiplier, giving my team hard problems (like SDUI) and the autonomy to solve them.

## Favorite Quote

> "Multipliers get more from their people because they expect more."

## How It Shaped My Work

This book directly influenced my leadership philosophy. By acting as a multiplier rather than a diminisher, I've built autonomous teams where every designer acts as a product owner, amplifying the organization's intelligence rather than constraining it. This approach, combined with [Radical Candor](/library/radical-candor), shaped how I established [design peer reviews](/blog/design-peer-reviews-to-support-our-team-growth) and built our design culture.
