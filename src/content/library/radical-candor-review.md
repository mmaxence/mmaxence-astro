## Key Insights

### Care Personally, Challenge Directly

The foundation of my feedback loop.

## Practical Applications

### Design Peer Reviews

I established a culture where designers perform radically candid reviews to secure the quality of our design system.

## How It Shaped My Work

Radical Candor has become the cornerstone of how I give feedback and build culture. By caring personally while challenging directly, I've created an environment where designers can give honest, constructive feedback without fear, leading to higher quality work and stronger team bonds. This directly influenced our [design peer review process](/blog/design-peer-reviews-to-support-our-team-growth) and complements the [Multiplier](/library/multipliers) leadership approach.
